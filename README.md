# browser-use Docker Container

    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxx
    ports:
      - '5900:5900'
```

Run the container:

```sh
docker compose up
```

Access the container shell to manually run scripts inside the container:

```sh
docker compose exec browser-use bash
```

Run `browser-use` inside the container:

```sh
python gpt-demo.py
```

## Connect via VNC
